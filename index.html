				<h2>Explore the Cosmos</h2>

				<p class= "one">I think it's safe to say humans are naturally curious creatures. Humans should go to space simply because,
				not doing so would be a like suppressing natural human instincts. One should consider entertaining the idea of
				living on an object other than earth, it is likely an evolutionary inevitability.</p>

					<figcaption> DID YOU KNOW #1? Space is an unfathomably large place so large in fact that some of the light from different places
					in space haven't reached us yet.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p class= "two">With bigger developments in rocket and propulsion technologies the price for a ticket to space will decrease
				 and the cosmos will become more accessible to the average american civilian. Eventually civilian astronaut pilots
				 might even exist piloting their own space craft, navigating through space. So why not explore space? The last time
				 there was a space race Americans got all kinds of new technology, all I'm saying is it won't hurt to explore.   </p>

				<h2>Search for Alien Life</h2>


					<p class= "three">Don't you want to know if there are any other life forms in the Universe besides what we have here on Earth? Well
					if the United States creates a Space Force the  long awaited proof of alien life will be expedited, information like
					that might have the potential to change the world. If we find alien plants on different planets we may be able to us
					them as we do with the plants we have on Earth, they could be very useful. </p>

					<p class= "four">We may come into contact with other intelligent life forms, this is entirely possible. If an interaction such as
					this were to happen, it would surly change how everyone views reality and may even bring humans together, to put away
					there differences. Also, wouldn't it be awesome to have a friend that was an alien? Imagine an alien sharing its culture
					 with you, that would be quite a spectacle and that is all the more reason to have a Space Force.</p>

				<h2>Potentially Massive Intellectual Breakthroughs</h2>

				<p class= "five">If America had a Space Foce there would be an explosion in scientific breakthroughs, new elements would be added to
				 the periodic table  due to new resources for space exploration. Huge developments in communication technologies will occur,
				 maybe information sent via light will be the new way to send a message. Lets not forget that satellite TV came from the previous
				 space race, it almost seems like everything from the last space race was good, or am I mistaken? (Feel free to leave a comment at the bottom of the page)</p>
